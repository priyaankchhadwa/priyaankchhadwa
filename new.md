# Using CSS in Readme.md file

Readme.md files do not allow direct CSS classes injection.

Though, there are several ways you can inject a CSS file or link into your README.md file, I prefer using the SVG files for simple styling or even complex charts and tables. [see my simple `Readme.md` example with SVG styling][1]

## ![plot](./title.svg)

This is a title that can be manipulated.

## ![plot](./subTitle.svg)

This is a sub-title with cyan color but can be manipulated
